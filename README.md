- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version >= 6 recommended) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (version >= 1 recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (running locally or a MongoDB Atlas cluster setup)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/BunyaminYavuz/Devfolio.git](https://github.com/BunyaminYavuz/Devfolio.git)

2.  **Navigate to the backend and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd Devfolio/server
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables for the backend:**

      - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.
      - Add your MongoDB connection URI and the desired port for the backend server:
        ```
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        PORT=5000
        # Add other necessary environment variables (e.g., email configuration)
        ```

4.  **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or yarn start
